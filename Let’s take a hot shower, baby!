Let’s take a hot shower, baby!

my arms wrap tightly around my knees
protecting
I see your blurred outline
with such a distance…. but I am numb to your presence
my heart beats louder than it should in this dull heaviness
since three month we’ve been talking for two hours
you don't know the answer to my question
I'm running out of questions
the answers are slowly becoming trivial

I find it nice how my arm is stroked
the small stars that flow through my body
so uncomfortably comfortable
I know exactly how late it is
I am blissfully ignorant,
that it's not your hand that caresses me
I love so much
But not with you

The stream is pouring down on me
the water seeps through my pores
it purifies and evokes
emotions
fears cling to everything they can grasp
favoring my throat
this intense feeling of being alone takes over me
and it hurts so good

I contradict myself without realising it
I say once more no
I say once more I need time for myself
and I talk to everyone until late at night
maybe because I know exactly that you’ll no longer come
I see how painful it is for you
I remain silent
it shatters my cold heart 

green quietly turns brown 
the holly stings sting me
the watering can next to it is filled to the brim with water
and the avocado grows every day

the colors of the old photos are still vibrant
I am still in love
stumbling through the streets I can’t find my house anymore…. I can no longer find my house
as if my home wasn’t my home anymore
how much do I still like it here and how much do I fear another place?
another stubbed out cigarette
"I know what you already know, but don’t say yet"

first dates after countless dates
despair, doubts and dilemmas … discord
the mulled wine has a dark red colour
luckily it’s the one warming me and not you

my bed smells like you
I'm taking the sheets out of the dryer
now is the time to take a shower
because freshly showered in freshly washed bed sheets is always nice
