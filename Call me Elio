Call me Elio

"Did you distance yourself from him?
because it's so unclear where you stand,
as a means to protect yourself?"
"Yes"

I can't help but smile,
when I tell you about him
My inner joy yearns to be let out,
it wants to jump around
it desires to have every experience
Gives the assurance a clearly secure appearance
But it’s loud
and our bond is quiet

"Don't worry so much"
You've already told me that, and I've already told you that
"Yes, true, true, I’ll just enjoy it"
But we both know that I won’t
I’m seeing things in my head
and meanings are piled up on top of one another
My own value becomes worthless,
your pedestal is priceless

I can't help but smile,
when I tell you about him
But my eyes have lost their sparkle,
they search the but
the reason for the why-not
the explanation for the let’s-see-where-this-goes

because I don't know when’s the next time we'll see each other 
And all of the sudden I’m hearing the things,
which you told me three weeks ago
My nose turns red
I text you
responding to my open question from the day before yesterday

And everything forgotten again,
when I'm being hold by your arms
I ask you if you'll stay
And you stay at a distance
The air is thick with loss and indecision
Who has got the time nowadays?

A never-ending search for something better
Without losing the now
Constantly ambivalent
I give it importance
But hold on!
Only if you do it too,
And if you don't, I won't
We're playing a game,
hating the rules

When will I give up on this, which in my delusional mind has so much potential?
When will I give up on this potential in my delusional mind?
How can we build up closeness and trust
if we constantly approach each other with such caution and deliberation
automatically creating distance?
Can that be overcome?

We take so much out of ourselves,
that we heal faster than we should
each time having less to give,
when we start with someone new

But to feel nothing, so as to feel anything,
What a waste!

"Did you distance yourself from him?
because it's so unclear where you stand,
as a means to protect yourself?"
"Yes..."
