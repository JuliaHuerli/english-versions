Strawberry Sorbet in Winter | 2024

I’m letting the dog dance,
my eyes are closed
Today is bluebird,
Glitter on the ground
The handrail is being embraced by wisteria
And me by you

The needle wanders into the vinyl’s centre
A stubbed out cigarette
The chaos of the city can't harm us
From the dark green leaves, light green leaves emerge
We put the ice cream in the freezer for later

The sun is hot 
and the wind is cold
It's summer in the sun
And winter in the shade
The meadows are green and lush
We're playing the game rooster or hen
And you ask me if I like butter

We got caught in the downpour
But we run over the crosswalk
One hand in yours,
the other on my side
I have a stich from laughing

The red Tom is lying in the watery ditch
And I've forgotten how much a hundred francs is
I know you’re by my side
I feel safe
The cow glows orange, 
It only has eyes for us
I’m smiling like a wide-mouthed frog

I draw a cross under the circle in the bathroom
Tic... tac... toe...
Time goes by
Putting worries aside and enjoying the moment
The little hand on the big clock face vanishes

I get out of tram number 4,
chill out for three rounds at the Limmat,
two glasses of Aperol
One thing is certain
Strawberry fields are forever
